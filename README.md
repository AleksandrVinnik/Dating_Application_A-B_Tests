# Dating_Application_A-B_Tests
 Repository of my educational work for the course "Data Analyst" at Karpov.Courses - © https://karpov.courses/analytics

● Project description: 

The application team developed a new algorithm for finding the most suitable profiles. To test the algorithm's performance, an A/B test was conducted. All users were divided into two groups. Users in Group 0 used the application with the old algorithm, while all users in Group 1 used the application with the new algorithm for profile search. The task is to evaluate whether the new algorithm has improved the service's quality.

The data includes logs of user interactions with each other.



● List of methods and technologies used with brief descriptions:

 - Python for data analysis:
	- pandas - data load an transformation
	- matplotlib - data visualisation
	- seaborn - data visualisation
	- scipy.stats - statistical tests
	- pingouin - statistical tests

 - GIT.



● Obtained results with visualization:

Short summary:

In the new version of the application, there has been a statistically significant increase in the average number of actions performed by users in test group.

Furthermore, the conversion rate has also significantly increased for test group, along with the average metric values across users.

Considering the observed statistically significant growth in the target metrics, it is recommended to deploy the new profile search system for all users in commercial operation.
